Develop a community based gamification solution for the waterrower

# Mission
The idea is to develop a cloud based platform to have more fund and gamification with the waterrower. 
Core features of the solution should be:
- Transmit data from the waterrower to firebase in realtime via Java Program and USB (later also via BLE and App)
- Same Java Programn send data to the waterrower triggered by the Web Portal
- Web Portal to manage user, tracks, runs, competitions and community

# Vision
The core idea is to use gamification in combination with the waterrower. Beside simple scoreboards, possibility to setup runs with existing runs from other user to have live events, challenges, group rowing etc. 

# History and Community
I have started this initiative already in 2019 but I do not have the knowledge, capacity and power to run such kind of initiative by myself. Therefore I open up this initiative and I would like to build a community which has the power to bring that initiative forward. 
As soon as there are others who would like to join the community we will make the existing code pubic and develop the system together.
